# FungalDx_CandidaID
Data processing of NanoString output for Candida species 

This collection of functions can be implemented with the example data (DataSet.csv), or any NanoString binding data in this format. These functions can be implemented to normalize NanoString binding data (DxData), assess sample species based on probe binding ratios (ProbeRatio), and visualise the correlation of binding profiles between two sample sets (e.g. test and reference) (DxCorrelation).
